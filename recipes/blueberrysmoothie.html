        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This smoothie is quick, easy to make, and will have you enjoying breakfast in a way you never have. 
            It's low on calories as well as effort, so there is never any excuse to not eat breakfast again. 
            With just a few simple ingredients and a blender, you could have a healthy breakfast in minutes. 
            You can even increase the recipe to make enough for two people or even make enough to meal prep!
            The shake will hold for a few days in the fridge, but it is best served soon after making it.
